  # A connection to a single Kafka broker.
  #
  # Usually you'll need a separate connection to each broker in a cluster, since most
  # requests must be directed specifically to the broker that is currently leader for
  # the set of topic partitions you want to produce to or consume from.
  #
  # ## Instrumentation
  #
  # Connections emit a `request.connection.kafka` notification on each request. The following
  # keys will be found in the payload:
  #
  # * `:api` — the name of the API being invoked.
  # * `:request_size` — the number of bytes in the request.
  # * `:response_size` — the number of bytes in the response.
  #
  # The notification also includes the duration of the request.
  #
