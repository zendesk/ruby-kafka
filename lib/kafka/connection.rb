module Kafka

  # A connection to a single Kafka broker.
  #
  # Usually you'll need a separate connection to each broker in a cluster, since most
  # requests must be directed specifically to the broker that is currently leader for
  # the set of topic partitions you want to produce to or consumer from.
  #
  # ## Instrumentation
  #
  # Connections emit a `request.connection.kafka` notification on each request. The following
  # keys will be found in the payload:
  #
  # * `:api` — the name of the API being invoked.
  # * `:request_size` — the number of bytes in the request.
  # * `:response_size` — the number of bytes in the response.
  #
  # The notification also includes the duration of the request.
  #

    # Opens a connection to a Kafka broker.
    #
    # @param host [String] the hostname of the broker.
    # @param port [Integer] the port of the broker.
    # @param client_id [String] the client id is a user-specified string sent in each
    #   request to help trace calls and should logically identify the application
    #   making the request.
    # @param logger [Logger] the logger used to log trace messages.
    # @param connect_timeout [Integer] the socket timeout for connecting to the broker.
    #   Default is 10 seconds.
    # @param socket_timeout [Integer] the socket timeout for reading and writing to the
    #   broker. Default is 10 seconds.

    # @return [Connection] a new connection.
