require "kafka/protocol/message_set"

module Kafka
  # A produce operation attempts to send all messages in a buffer to the Kafka cluster.
  # Since topics and partitions are spread among all brokers in a cluster, this usually
  # involves sending requests to several or all of the brokers.
  #
  # ## Instrumentation
  #
  # When executing the operation, an `ack_message.producer.kafka` notification will be
  # emitted for each message that was successfully appended to a topic partition.
  # The following keys will be found in the payload:
  #
  # * `:topic` — the topic that was written to.
  # * `:partition` — the partition that the message set was appended to.
  # * `:offset` — the offset of the message in the partition.
  # * `:key` — the message key.
  # * `:value` — the message value.
  # * `:delay` — the time between the message was produced and when it was acknowledged.
  #
  # In addition to these notifications, a `send_messages.producer.kafka` notification will
  # be emitted after the operation completes, regardless of whether it succeeds. This
  # notification will have the following keys:
  #
  # * `:message_count` – the total number of messages that the operation tried to
  #   send. Note that not all messages may get delivered.
  # * `:sent_message_count` – the number of messages that were successfully sent.
