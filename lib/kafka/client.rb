    # Fetches a batch of messages from a single partition. Note that it's possible
    # to get back empty batches.
    #
    # The starting point for the fetch can be configured with the `:offset` argument.
    # If you pass a number, the fetch will start at that offset. However, there are
    # two special Symbol values that can be passed instead:
    #
    # * `:earliest` — the first offset in the partition.
    # * `:latest` — the next offset that will be written to, effectively making the
    #   call block until there is a new message in the partition.
    #
    # The Kafka protocol specifies the numeric values of these two options: -2 and -1,
    # respectively. You can also pass in these numbers directly.
    #
    # ## Example
    #
    # When enumerating the messages in a partition, you typically fetch batches
    # sequentially.
    #
    #     offset = :earliest
    #
    #     loop do
    #       messages = kafka.fetch_messages(
    #         topic: "my-topic",
    #         partition: 42,
    #         offset: offset,
    #       )
    #
    #       messages.each do |message|
    #         puts message.offset, message.key, message.value
    #
    #         # Set the next offset that should be read to be the subsequent
    #         # offset.
    #         offset = message.offset + 1
    #       end
    #     end

    # @param topic [String] the topic that messages should be fetched from.

    # @param partition [Integer] the partition that messages should be fetched from.
    #
    # @param offset [Integer, Symbol] the offset to start reading from. Default is
    #   the latest offset.
    #
    # @param max_wait_time [Integer] the maximum amount of time to wait before
    #   the server responds, in seconds.
    #
    # @param min_bytes [Integer] the minimum number of bytes to wait for. If set to
    #   zero, the broker will respond immediately, but the response may be empty.
    #   The default is 1 byte, which means that the broker will respond as soon as
    #   a message is written to the partition.
    #
    # @param max_bytes [Integer] the maximum number of bytes to include in the
    #   response message set. Default is 1 MB. You need to set this higher if you
    #   expect messages to be larger than this.
