module Kafka

  # Allows sending messages to a Kafka cluster.
  #
  # Typically you won't instantiate this class yourself, but rather have {Kafka::Client}
  # do it for you, e.g.
  #
  #     # Will instantiate Kafka::Client
  #     kafka = Kafka.new(...)
  #
  #     # Will instantiate Kafka::Producer
  #     producer = kafka.get_producer
  #
  # This is done in order to share a logger as well as a pool of broker connections across
  # different producers. This also means that you don't need to pass the `cluster` and
  # `logger` options to `#get_producer`. See {#initialize} for the list of other options
  # you can pass in.
  #
  # ## Buffering
  #
  # The producer buffers pending messages until {#send_messages} is called. Note that there is
  # a maximum buffer size (default is 1,000 messages) and writing messages after the
  # buffer has reached this size will result in a BufferOverflow exception. Make sure
  # to periodically call {#send_messages} or set `max_buffer_size` to an appropriate value.
  #
  # Buffering messages and sending them in batches greatly improves performance, so
  # try to avoid sending messages after every write. The tradeoff between throughput and
  # message delays depends on your use case.
  #
  # ## Error Handling and Retries
  #
  # The design of the error handling is based on having a {MessageBuffer} hold messages
  # for all topics/partitions. Whenever we want to send messages to the cluster, we
  # group the buffered messages by the broker they need to be sent to and fire off a
  # request to each broker. A request can be a partial success, so we go through the
  # response and inspect the error code for each partition that we wrote to. If the
  # write to a given partition was successful, we clear the corresponding messages
  # from the buffer -- otherwise, we log the error and keep the messages in the buffer.
  #
  # After this, we check if the buffer is empty. If it is, we're all done. If it's
  # not, we do another round of requests, this time with just the remaining messages.
  # We do this for as long as `max_retries` permits.
  #
  # ## Example
  #
  # This is an example of an application which reads lines from stdin and writes them
  # to Kafka:
  #
  #     require "kafka"
  #
  #     logger = Logger.new($stderr)
  #     brokers = ENV.fetch("KAFKA_BROKERS").split(",")
  #
  #     # Make sure to create this topic in your Kafka cluster or configure the
  #     # cluster to auto-create topics.
  #     topic = "random-messages"
  #
  #     kafka = Kafka.new(
  #       seed_brokers: brokers,
  #       client_id: "simple-producer",
  #       logger: logger,
  #     )
  #
  #     producer = kafka.get_producer
  #
  #     begin
  #       $stdin.each_with_index do |line, index|
  #         producer.produce(line, topic: topic)
  #
  #         # Send messages for every 10 lines.
  #         producer.send_messages if index % 10 == 0
  #       end
  #     ensure
  #       # Make sure to send any remaining messages.
  #       producer.send_messages
  #
  #       producer.shutdown
  #     end
  #
  class Producer

    # Initializes a new Producer.

    # @param cluster [Cluster]
    #
    # @param logger [Logger] the logger that should be used. Typically passed
    #   in for you.
    #
    # @param ack_timeout [Integer] The number of seconds a broker can wait for
    #   replicas to acknowledge a write before responding with a timeout.
    #
    # @param required_acks [Integer] The number of replicas that must acknowledge
    #   a write.
    #
    # @param max_retries [Integer] the number of retries that should be attempted
    #   before giving up sending messages to the cluster. Does not include the
    #   original attempt.
    #
    # @param retry_backoff [Integer] the number of seconds to wait between retries.
    #
    # @param max_buffer_size [Integer] the number of messages allowed in the buffer
    #   before new writes will raise BufferOverflow exceptions.

    #
    # ## Partitioning
    #
    # There are several options for specifying the partition that the message should
    # be written to.
    #
    # The simplest option is to not specify a message key, partition key, or
    # partition number, in which case the message will be assigned a partition at
    # random.
    #
    # You can also specify the `partition` parameter yourself. This requires you to
    # know which partitions are available, however. Oftentimes the best option is
    # to specify the `partition_key` parameter: messages with the same partition
    # key will always be assigned to the same partition, as long as the number of
    # partitions doesn't change. You can also omit the partition key and specify
    # a message key instead. The message key is part of the message payload, and
    # so can carry semantic value--whether you want to have the message key double
    # as a partition key is up to you.
    #
    # @param value [String] the message data.
    # @param key [String] the message key.
    # @param topic [String] the topic that the message should be written to.
    # @param partition [Integer] the partition that the message should be written to.
    # @param partition_key [String] the key that should be used to assign a partition.
    #
    # @raise [BufferOverflow] if the maximum buffer size has been reached.
    # @return [nil]
    def produce(value, key: nil, topic:, partition: nil, partition_key: nil)
      unless buffer_size < @max_buffer_size
        raise BufferOverflow, "Max buffer size #{@max_buffer_size} exceeded"
      end

      if partition.nil?
        # If no explicit partition key is specified we use the message key instead.
        partition_key ||= key
        partitioner = Partitioner.new(@cluster.partitions_for(topic))

    #
    # Depending on the value of `required_acks` used when initializing the producer,
    # this call may block until the specified number of replicas have acknowledged
