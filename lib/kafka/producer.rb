module Kafka
  # Allows sending messages to a Kafka cluster.
  #
  # Typically you won't instantiate this class yourself, but rather have {Kafka::Client}
  # do it for you, e.g.
  #
  #     # Will instantiate Kafka::Client
  #     kafka = Kafka.new(["kafka1:9092", "kafka2:9092"])
  #
  #     # Will instantiate Kafka::Producer
  #     producer = kafka.producer
  #
  # This is done in order to share a logger as well as a pool of broker connections across
  # different producers. This also means that you don't need to pass the `cluster` and
  # `logger` options to `#producer`. See {#initialize} for the list of other options
  # you can pass in.
  #
  # ## Buffering
  #
  # The producer buffers pending messages until {#deliver_messages} is called. Note that there is
  # a maximum buffer size (default is 1,000 messages) and writing messages after the
  # buffer has reached this size will result in a BufferOverflow exception. Make sure
  # to periodically call {#deliver_messages} or set `max_buffer_size` to an appropriate value.
  #
  # Buffering messages and sending them in batches greatly improves performance, so
  # try to avoid sending messages after every write. The tradeoff between throughput and
  # message delays depends on your use case.
  #
  # ## Error Handling and Retries
  #
  # The design of the error handling is based on having a {MessageBuffer} hold messages
  # for all topics/partitions. Whenever we want to send messages to the cluster, we
  # group the buffered messages by the broker they need to be sent to and fire off a
  # request to each broker. A request can be a partial success, so we go through the
  # response and inspect the error code for each partition that we wrote to. If the
  # write to a given partition was successful, we clear the corresponding messages
  # from the buffer -- otherwise, we log the error and keep the messages in the buffer.
  #
  # After this, we check if the buffer is empty. If it is, we're all done. If it's
  # not, we do another round of requests, this time with just the remaining messages.
  # We do this for as long as `max_retries` permits.
  #
  # ## Compression
  #
  # Depending on what kind of data you produce, enabling compression may yield improved
  # bandwidth and space usage. Compression in Kafka is done on entire messages sets
  # rather than on individual messages. This improves the compression rate and generally
  # means that compressions works better the larger your buffers get, since the message
  # sets will be larger by the time they're compressed.
  #
  # Since many workloads have variations in throughput and distribution across partitions,
  # it's possible to configure a threshold for when to enable compression by setting
  # `compression_threshold`. Only if the defined number of messages are buffered for a
  # partition will the messages be compressed.
  #
  # Compression is enabled by passing the `compression_codec` parameter with the
  # name of one of the algorithms allowed by Kafka:
  #
  # * `:snappy` for [Snappy](http://google.github.io/snappy/) compression.
  # * `:gzip` for [gzip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip) compression.
  # * `:lz4` for [LZ4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ4_(compression_algorithm)) compression.
  # * `:zstd` for [zstd](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/) compression.
  #
  # By default, all message sets will be compressed if you specify a compression
  # codec. To increase the compression threshold, set `compression_threshold` to
  # an integer value higher than one.
  #
  # ## Instrumentation
  #
  # Whenever {#produce} is called, the notification `produce_message.producer.kafka`
  # will be emitted with the following payload:
  #
  # * `value` – the message value.
  # * `key` – the message key.
  # * `topic` – the topic that was produced to.
  # * `buffer_size` – the buffer size after adding the message.
  # * `max_buffer_size` – the maximum allowed buffer size for the producer.
  #
  # After {#deliver_messages} completes, the notification
  # `deliver_messages.producer.kafka` will be emitted with the following payload:
  #
  # * `message_count` – the total number of messages that the producer tried to
  #   deliver. Note that not all messages may get delivered.
  # * `delivered_message_count` – the number of messages that were successfully
  #   delivered.
  # * `attempts` – the number of attempts made to deliver the messages.
  #
  # ## Example
  #
  # This is an example of an application which reads lines from stdin and writes them
  # to Kafka:
  #
  #     require "kafka"
  #
  #     logger = Logger.new($stderr)
  #     brokers = ENV.fetch("KAFKA_BROKERS").split(",")
  #
  #     # Make sure to create this topic in your Kafka cluster or configure the
  #     # cluster to auto-create topics.
  #     topic = "random-messages"
  #
  #     kafka = Kafka.new(brokers, client_id: "simple-producer", logger: logger)
  #     producer = kafka.producer
  #
  #     begin
  #       $stdin.each_with_index do |line, index|
  #         producer.produce(line, topic: topic)
  #
  #         # Send messages for every 10 lines.
  #         producer.deliver_messages if index % 10 == 0
  #       end
  #     ensure
  #       # Make sure to send any remaining messages.
  #       producer.deliver_messages
  #
  #       producer.shutdown
  #     end
  #

    # partition number, in which case the message will be assigned a partition at
    # random.
    #
    # You can also specify the `partition` parameter yourself. This requires you to
    # know which partitions are available, however. Oftentimes the best option is
    # to specify the `partition_key` parameter: messages with the same partition
    # key will always be assigned to the same partition, as long as the number of
    # partitions doesn't change. You can also omit the partition key and specify
    # a message key instead. The message key is part of the message payload, and
    # so can carry semantic value--whether you want to have the message key double
    # as a partition key is up to you.
    #
    # @param value [String] the message data.
    # @param key [String] the message key.
    # @param headers [Hash<String, String>] the headers for the message.
    # @param topic [String] the topic that the message should be written to.
    # @param partition [Integer] the partition that the message should be written to.
    # @param partition_key [String] the key that should be used to assign a partition.
    # @param create_time [Time] the timestamp that should be set on the message.
