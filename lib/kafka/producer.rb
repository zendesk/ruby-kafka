    # == Partitioning
    #
    # There are several options for specifying the partition that the message should
    # be written to. The simplest option is to not specify a partition or partition
    # key, in which case the message key will be used to select one of the available
    # partitions. You can also specify the `partition` parameter yourself. This
    # requires you to know which partitions are available, however. Oftentimes the
    # best option is to specify the `partition_key` parameter: messages with the
    # same partition key will always be assigned to the same partition, as long as
    # the number of partitions doesn't change.
    #
    # @param value [String] the message data.
    # @param key [String] the message key.
    # @param topic [String] the topic that the message should be written to.
    # @param partition [Integer] the partition that the message should be written to.
    # @param partition_key [String] the key that should be used to assign a partition.
    #
    # @return [Message] the message that was written.
    def write(value, key:, topic:, partition: nil, partition_key: nil)
      if partition.nil?
        # If no explicit partition key is specified we use the message key instead.
        partition_key ||= key

    # Flushes all messages to the Kafka brokers.
    #
    # Depending on the value of `required_acks` used when initializing the producer,
    # this call may block until the specified number of replicas have acknowledged
    # the writes. The `timeout` setting places an upper bound on the amount of time
    # the call will block before failing.
